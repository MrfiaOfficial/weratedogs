## Report: act_report
This report succinctly communicate the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from the wrangled data for the Wrangle Act Project.

The Wrangle Act project objective is to gathered data from three different sources, assessed, cleaned and merged the three cleaned datasets into a master data table. Also, made some analysis to get insights and made some visualizations so as to communicate some of our findings.

To guide our analysis, six pertinent questions were asked. I listed these six questions which are related to what the dataset is all about. These questions guided me to make some exploratory efforts to answer each of the questions.

## The questions are:

What are the five most popular dog breeds (breeds that appear more than others in the table?
Which dog breed has the highest retweet count?
What's the frequency distribution of the favorite count?
Is there a correlation between retweet count and favourite count?
What relational information can we get from the comparision of the dog age stages?
What dog's name is most popular (a name that appears more than others in the table)?
After a series of exploratory analysis, the answers I got to the stated analysis questions provided needed insights as required, and these insights were also used to generate some visualizations as needed.

## Some of the insights generated are:
The five most popular breeds of dog in our dataset are golden_retriever, labrador_retriever, pembroke, chihuahua, and pug.
The highest retweet_count = 79515.
Labrador Retriever breed has the highest retweet count.
The correlation coefficient (r) between retweet_count and favorite_count is "0.7908904272414722". this positive correlation coefficient that's very close to +1 denotes that there's a positive and strong correlation between retweet_count and favorite_count. This should be obvious since a tweet that's favorited by many people has the high posibility of been retweeted.
Among the defined age stages, pupper has the highest number of occurence, hence it's the age stage of most of the dogs. The sum of the other defined age stage counts is less than the pupper count.
